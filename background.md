# Background

As most of us know, global warming is one of the greatest issues facing our society today. It presents a fundamental threat to humanity's existence.

### How did we get here?

Global warming has not always been an issue for humanity. Although we have been using fire (which emits C02 and other harmful gasses) for upwards of a million years(1), the recent widespread use of fossil fuels and gasses for industrial use has greatly increased our levels of C02 emittance and pollution of the atmosphere. More specifically, many technological advancements in transportation and extraction have drastically reduced the price for many of these pollutants. They have become so cheap, in fact, that many manufacturers have been able to incorporate them into their products.

A notable example of this is plastics, which are essentially condensed oils and natural gasses. Thanks to their inexpensive nature, plastics have spread everywhere and can now be found in many everyday products we rely on. Because of their widespread use, a substantial amount oil, natural gas, and other extracts have been produced to meet demand. This is a large contributing factor to global emissions.
