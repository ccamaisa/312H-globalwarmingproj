# Background

As most of us know, global warming is one of the greatest issues facing our society today. It presents a fundamental threat to humanity's existence, and solving it is a challenge due to our dependence on unsustainable energy sources.

### How did we get here?

Global warming has not always been an issue for humanity. Although we have been using fire (which emits C02 and other harmful gasses) for upwards of a million years(1), the recent widespread use of fossil fuels and gasses for industrial use has greatly increased our levels of C02 emittance and pollution of the atmosphere. More specifically, many technological advancements in transportation and extraction have drastically reduced the price for many of these pollutants. They have become so cheap, in fact, that many have been able to incorporate them into their products/goods/services.

As we see in the graph above, global emissions have rapidly increased over the last 100 years as demand for manufacturing and cheap sources of energy has grown exponentially. 

There are many sources of harmful emissions, such as transportation, agriculture, and energy, to name a few. The main takeaway here is that the development of the modern world has led to an intense reliance on unsustainable resources across the board due to the efficiencies and advancements that have made them ultra-cheap.

Because society was not aware of fossil fuels' dangers in the mid-20th century when global interdependence was taking root, we came to be reliant on these harmful sources of energy. With the world's current dominant economic system being capitalism, many corporations have and are incentivized to utilize the cheapest materials and manufacturing processes in order to maximize profit and revenue margins.
