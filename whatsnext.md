# What's Next?
The world's increasing reliance on fossil fuels means we emit a staggering amount of emissions, and those emissions pose a grave threat to our survival. But what *actually* needs to get done?

Just a few decades ago, humanity was largely unaware of the grave dangers that greenhouse gasses posed to its very existence. Before we knew it, our world was dependent on them for nearly everything, and sometimes it seems as if it is too late. Despite the horrifying numbers and predictions, it isn't too late to stop global warming, or at least dampen its effects. Drastic action needs to be immediately taken by world governments (specifically developing nations) to prevent and restrict the release of harmful toxins into the atmosphere.

### Where do we start?
In my opinion, one of the best things to visualize what action needs to be taken to stop global warming is the carbon budget. 

The most commonly referred-to version of the budget is the one which was outlined in the Paris Accord in 2015. Nearly every country agreed to hold the global average temperature at or 1.5°C above "pre-industrial" averages.

As the graph above shows, we will need to drastically reduce our emissions within the next few years to meet this goal. Although efforts to combat this warming are helping, they are currently nowhere near where they need to be. What seems to be a more plausible goal is the 2°C budget. Although not optimal, this gives countries ample time to react and respond to the crisis. Drastic cuts in nonrenewables, specifically oil, will still need to be made within this decade to stay on track for this more lenient budget.

This carbon budget of 2 degrees seems more plausible, now that we start looking at it. Alas, things are easier said than done. There will have to be a massive international cooperative push to limit the uses of fossil fuels. Given that many developing nations are reliant on them for economic development in one form or another, it will be a challenge to be sure, and enforcing it no easy task.


### What can we (as individuals) do?

Carbon taxes will need to be imposed, new methods of sustainable transport will need to be popularized, and the global agriculture industry will have to figure out ways to reduce their emissions (I'm looking at you, cattle). Again, we are starting to see some movement in the right direction, but it is ultimately up to our leaders to enforce and propel these initiatives forward. Placing people into public positions that are aware of the issue and can address it is paramount, and it starts with your vote. Personal adjustments, although they may seem insignificant, are also great ways to combat global warming. Use public  transportation when you can, eat less beef, and reduce your overall footprint through thoughtful lifestyle choices.
