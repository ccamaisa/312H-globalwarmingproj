## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my project!
This site aims to explain global warming through globalism and its influences. By doing so, we can not only more accurately predict the causes of this crisis, but also formulate realistic goals considering the international reliance globalism has created for modern society.


### What is this?
In short, the goal of this site is to illustrate Globalism's deep interconnection to the current "climate crisis" we are facing as a society. I will go into depth on three topics, which are seperated into three different pages:

##### [Background](https://ccamaisa.github.io/312H-globalwarmingproj/background)
This page is aimed at answering the question, "How did we get here?" through the analysis of historical trends of global warming and its involvement with globalism and industrialization. We will also explore the statistics and metrics of today and attempt to pinpoint the largest polluters by sector and region.

#### [Effects](https://ccamaisa.github.io/312H-globalwarmingproj/effects)
In Effects, we will look at the consequences of global warming in the past, present, and future using the United Nations IPCC SR-15 climate forecasting report.

#### [What's Next?](https://ccamaisa.github.io/312H-globalwarmingproj/whatsnext)
This section will explore what society has and can do to meet the targets set forth by the world's leading scientists and researchers to minimize the impacts of global warming.
